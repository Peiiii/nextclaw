# @nextclaw/ncp-react

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- Raise the frontend NCP attachment upload limit from 10MB to 200MB.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Unify the NCP file pipeline around an asset store abstraction with `put`, `export`, and `stat`.

  This release removes default prompt-time file content injection, replaces `attachmentUri` with `assetUri`, adds `asset_put` / `asset_export` / `asset_stat`, and updates the UI/server upload flow to return and render managed assets directly.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @nextclaw/ncp@0.4.0
  - @nextclaw/ncp-toolkit@0.4.4

## 0.3.6

### Patch Changes

- Ship the full set of current unreleased workspace package changes in one release batch, including the server/CLI updates already sitting in the working tree and the previously committed public package drift that has not been published yet. Republish the NCP agent runtime export surface so NextClaw can resolve `LocalAttachmentStore` after update, and add a release guard that blocks shipping public workspace dependents when a package has drifted past its published tag without a pending changeset.
- Updated dependencies
  - @nextclaw/ncp@0.3.3
  - @nextclaw/ncp-toolkit@0.4.3

## 0.3.5

### Patch Changes

- ee69ef6: Keep pasted and uploaded NCP images in composer order end to end: preserve caret placement, retain image visibility across follow-up turns without hidden model switching, and serialize mixed text/image message parts in the same order users authored them.

## 0.3.4

### Patch Changes

- Add NCP image attachment support across the shared chat composer, NCP runtime, React bindings, and bundled NextClaw UI so pasted or uploaded images are sent as NCP file parts and rendered inline. Also keep the required CLI/server/mcp release group in sync for the bundled NextClaw distribution.
  - @nextclaw/ncp-toolkit@0.4.2

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- Republish all public workspace packages with pnpm publish guards so released manifests no longer retain workspace:\* dependencies and future npm publish misuse is blocked before release.
- Updated dependencies
  - @nextclaw/ncp@0.3.2
  - @nextclaw/ncp-toolkit@0.4.2

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- Republish the NCP-linked package set so published consumers resolve the
  latest NCP protocol/runtime exports used by the current NextClaw CLI build.
- Updated dependencies
  - @nextclaw/ncp@0.3.1
  - @nextclaw/ncp-toolkit@0.4.1

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Unify the latest NCP native chat chain improvements into a single release batch:
  - fix NCP streaming/state-manager promotion so tool-first assistant streams do not lose parts
  - align session type handling to stay generic outside the built-in native type
  - remove runtime-specific default-model branching and use a generic session-scoped fallback strategy
  - ship the latest NextClaw UI, server, and CLI cutover fixes together
  - republish direct dependents of `@nextclaw/ncp-toolkit` for version alignment

- Updated dependencies
  - @nextclaw/ncp-toolkit@0.4.0

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Unify the latest NCP native chat chain, runtime capability assembly, chat UI alignment, stream/reasoning/tool fixes, and marketplace metadata publishing into a single minor release.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @nextclaw/ncp@0.3.0
  - @nextclaw/ncp-toolkit@0.3.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Refactor the NCP agent backend stack from run-centric semantics to session-centric live execution.
  - Replace run-based stream and abort payloads with `sessionId`-based live session APIs.
  - Rename the manifest capability from `supportsRunStream` to `supportsLiveSessionStream`.
  - Remove run-store/controller abstractions from `@nextclaw/ncp-toolkit` and move active execution ownership into the live session registry.
  - Align the HTTP client/server transports and React hooks with live session streaming.
  - Update `ncp-demo` to use the session-centric backend, add a `sleep` tool, and remove mock LLM mode.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @nextclaw/ncp@0.2.0
  - @nextclaw/ncp-toolkit@0.2.0
